A competitor targets a manufacturing company's AI-driven supply chain management system. The attacker subtly manipulates the data that the AI relies on to make decisions. Over time, they introduce small, seemingly random errors into the system’s input data—like false reports of shortages in certain raw materials, exaggerated shipping delays, or incorrect demand forecasts for key products. To do so, the attacker infiltrates the company's network through a compromised third-party vendor, gaining access to the data streams that feed into the AI system. The AI, which bases its decisions on this tampered data, begins to make suboptimal choices: it orders excessive amounts of some materials while understocking others, reroutes shipments unnecessarily, and even prioritizes the production of less profitable products. These errors lead to inefficiencies, increased costs, and missed opportunities, gradually eroding the company's competitive edge. This scenario demonstrates how AI systems that heavily depend on data inputs can be exploited through data poisoning, leading to significant business disruptions without the need for impersonation.
