In a close and contentious national election, the election commission decides to use an AI-powered voting system to streamline and secure the voting process. The AI system is designed to handle voter registration, validate identities, and ensure that all votes are accurately counted and attributed to the correct candidates.
During the election, the AI system is responsible for verifying voter identities through facial recognition and cross-referencing voter ID numbers with the electoral roll. It also manages the electronic ballot submissions, detecting any anomalies or attempts at fraud.
However, a critical flaw in the AI system's algorithm causes it to misinterpret certain facial features and ID numbers, incorrectly flagging legitimate votes as fraudulent. As a result, a significant number of valid ballots are erroneously marked as suspicious and set aside for further review, while a small percentage of fraudulent ballots are allowed through due to an insufficiently rigorous fraud detection protocol.
