In a criminal trial, the prosecution uses an AI system to analyze DNA evidence collected from a crime scene. The AI is designed to match genetic profiles from the scene with those of suspects and determine likelihoods of a match. The system incorrectly concludes that the DNA matches a suspect due to a flaw in its algorithm, overlooking the fact that the genetic profile closely resembles several individuals in a large database. As a result, the wrong person is accused, and the trial proceeds based on this erroneous evidence. The mistake leads to a wrongful conviction, later overturned upon discovery of the AIâ€™s error and the real perpetrator being identified.
