In a high-profile criminal trial, the prosecution is trying a wealthy business magnate, Mr. Daniels, for bribery and corruption. The evidence is complex, and the judge has issued strict instructions on what the jury can and cannot see to ensure a fair trial. The prosecution team uses an AI tool to assist with evidence management, specifically to filter out any prejudicial material before presenting evidence to the jury. The AI is tasked with reviewing thousands of documents and video recordings, automatically flagging and redacting anything that could unfairly influence the jury, such as prior bad acts or irrelevant personal information about Mr. Daniels. The AI’s job is to ensure only the admissible, relevant evidence is shown in court. During the trial, the prosecution submits a video recording that the AI has approved. However, the AI made a critical error—it failed to redact a brief segment where Mr. Daniels is heard making a derogatory remark about a minority group, unrelated to the charges. This prejudicial statement immediately catches the jury’s attention and biases them against the defendant. The defense objects, and after reviewing the situation, the judge rules that the jury has been improperly exposed to highly prejudicial information that could not be "unheard" or ignored. As a result, the judge declares a mistrial, throwing out the entire case. The error forces the prosecution to restart the lengthy legal process, damaging their credibility and potentially jeopardizing the chance for a fair retrial.
