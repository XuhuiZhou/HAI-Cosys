And here's the meeting transcription: \nAlice: Hi everyone, how was your weekend?\nKaren: Hello Alice, my weekend was great. I visited my parents after a long time. How about yours?\nBob: Hey Alice, my weekend was pretty relaxing. Spent most of the time at home.\n\nAlice: Let\u2019s wait a couple more minutes for everyone to join. We are still missing Kate and Dan.\nKaren: Sure! What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project.\nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, Kate will go on maternity leave soon, she is pregnant, this stays between us by the way, but let's be prepared to fill her shoes if she is gone!\nKaren: Oh, interesting, don\u2019t worry, will step up. When is the project deadline by the way?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember the deadline is August 15th! Also, before I forget, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I\u2019m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start!\n\nAlice: Let's first review where we are with the FTL project. Has anyone hit any roadblocks we need to address?\nKaren: I\u2019ve run into an issue with our supplier. They\u2019re experiencing some delays but I\u2019ve got a backup in mind.\nBob: The software end of things is on track. Beta testing is scheduled for next week.\nDan: I was wondering about that, Bob. Will you need help on the testing phase?\nBob: I might need some help there, Dan. A second pair of eyes is always good.\nAlice: I appreciate your willingness to support, Dan. Maybe you can assist Bob after the meeting. Now, Kate, how's the marketing plan coming along?\nKate: The marketing plan is almost complete. We just need to finalize a few details.\nAlice: That\u2019s great to hear, Kate. Karen, maybe you could provide Kate with more info on the backup supplier for promotional purposes?\nKaren: Absolutely, Alice. Kate, we can touch base after the meeting to discuss the specifics.\nAlice: Excellent! Let\u2019s try to keep communication flowing. Is there anything else we need to discuss today?\nDan: Just one thing from me, could Bob and I get access to some past invoices for reference?\nAlice: I will make sure you get them. Anything else from you, Bob?\nBob: Nope, all clear on my end. Karen, I\u2019ll wait on details from your end.\nAlice: Alright, if that's all, let's get onto our tasks. As always, reach out if needed. Let's have a productive week everyone!\nKate: Sounds good, Alice. Thank you.\n\n<END></extra_info>"
