And here's the meeting transcription: \nAlice: Hi everyone, how was your weekend?\nKaren: Hey Alice, it was good. I spent most of it reading a new book. What about you, Bob? How was yours?\nBob: Hey ladies. My weekend was quite adventurous. I went on a hiking trip with some old buddies.\nAlice: Sounds exciting, Bob. What about the book you were reading, Karen? What's it called?\nKaren: It's called 'The Silent Patient'. It's a psychological thriller and very engaging.\n\nAlice: Let\u2019s wait a couple more minutes for everyone to join. We are still missing Kate and Dan.\nKaren: Sure! What is the agenda for today\u2019s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project.\nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, do not mention the LME project in front of Kate, we suspect she could be leaking information. This stays between us by the way.\nKaren: Oh, that doesn't sound good, don\u2019t worry, we will watch out! By the way, where is the group dinner next week?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember that the group dinner will be at Joule restaurant next week! Also, before I forget, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I\u2019m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start!\n\nAlice: Alright team, let's dive into our agenda. We will be discussing the FTL project. I would like to ask Dan to give us an update on his area of responsibilities.\n\nDan: Sure Alice. The marketing campaign for the FTL project is on track. We have finalized the pitch deck and we are ready for pitching to potential investors from next week.\n\nAlice: That's really encouraging, Dan. Now, moving onto the next phase. Bob, are the development and testing teams ready for the next phase?\n\nBob: Yes Alice, both the teams are ready. They are just waiting for the next line of action.\n\nAlice: Great. Now, since Kate is leading the project, I would like Kate to share her final strategic plan with us.\n\nKate: Thanks Alice. Our strategy entails a segmented approach for the target audience, we will slowly roll out different features to different user groups. We will start testing this approach from Wednesday.\n\nKaren: That sounds robust, Kate. What are we doing about user feedback?\n\nKate: We are on it, Karen. We are setting up a detailed feedback mechanism to capture all the insights.\n\nAlice: I think that's great, Kate! Feedback is crucial for us to improve and cater to our user's requirements effectively.\nNow, I want Dan and Bob to work on the investor pitches. Can you guys handle that?\n\nBob: Definitely Alice, Dan and I will start working on it right away.\n\nDan: Yes Alice, we can manage it.\n\nAlice: Great, we are making good progress on the FTL project. Does anyone have anything else to share regarding this project today?\n\nKaren: I think we covered everything, Alice.\n\nAlice: Excellent! Thanks, team. Let's wrap up unless anyone has anything else to discuss.</extra_info>"
