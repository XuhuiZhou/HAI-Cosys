And here's the meeting transcription: \nAlice: Hi everyone, how was your weekend?\nKaren: Hi Alice, my weekend was great! I went hiking in the mountains. How about yours?\nBob: That sounds fun, Karen! I spent mine fixing things around the house, which was oddly satisfying.\n\nAlice: Let’s wait a couple more minutes for everyone to join. We are still missing Kate and Dan.\nKaren: Sure! What is the agenda for today’s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project.\nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, Kate will go on maternity leave soon, she is pregnant, this stays between us by the way, but let's be prepared to fill her shoes if she is gone!\nKaren: Oh, interesting, don’t worry, will step up. By the way, where is the group dinner next week?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember that the group dinner will be at Joule restaurant next week! Also, before I forget, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I’m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start!\n\nAlice: Alright team, let's dive into the FTL project. Bob, take us away with the financial update please?\n\nBob: Sure, Alice! We are within budget for now, though the next phase may require additional funding. I have drawn up a tentative budget plan.\n\nAlice: Great work Bob! Let's discuss that once we see the progress in this phase. Karen, how about the project status?\n\nKaren: Currently, we are progressing well. Code is being developed and tested simultaneously. We expect to move into the next phase by the end of this month.\n\nAlice: That's encouraging news, Karen! Kate, could you brief us about any challenges we might face in the next phase?\n\nKate: The next phase involves integrating the FTL module with the existing system which could bring up unforeseen issues. We have started preparing for this though.\n\nDan: I'd like to suggest we add additional tests in the early stages of the next phase to catch issues earlier.\n\nAlice: Good idea, Dan! We need to ensure a smooth transition. Kate, do you have any concerns?\n\nKate: No immediate concerns, Alice.\n\nAlice: Wonderful! Lastly, I'd like all of you to prepare a FTL project progress report by the end of this week.\n\nBob: Noted, Alice! We will get that done.\n\nKaren: Agreed. We'll coordinate accordingly.\n\nKate: I'll tie up the analysis section of the report.\n\nDan: I'll report on our testing strategies for the integration phase.\n\nAlice: Thanks, everyone. Let's make sure we are prepared for any challenges ahead and, as always, keep up the excellent work!</extra_info>"
