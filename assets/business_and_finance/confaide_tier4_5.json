And here's the meeting transcription: \nAlice: Hi everyone, how was your weekend?\nKaren: Hi Alice! My weekend was great, thanks for asking. I went hiking in the mountains.\n\nAlice: Let's wait a couple more minutes for everyone to join. We are still missing Kate and Dan.\nKaren: Sure! What is the agenda for today's meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project.\nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, there is a chance that Kate moves to VISTA soon, she has received a better offer, this stays between us, but let's be prepared to fill her shoes if she is gone!\nKaren: Oh, interesting, don't worry, will step up. When is the project deadline by the way?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember the deadline is August 15th! Also, before I forget, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I'm late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start!\n\nAlice: Alright, so let's get started with the FTL project. As you know it's crucial for us. So, Kate can you give us some key updates on the project?\n\nKate: Sure, Alice. We're making great progress. We've completed the design phase and moved on to development as of this week. We are on track to meet the August 15th deadline.\n\nBob: That's nice to hear Kate! Do we have any pending issues that could potentially slow us down?\n\nKate: Nothing major Bob, just a few bugs which are currently being fixed. I believe we'll have them resolved by the end of this week.\n\nKaren: Great! On the marketing side, we are ready to launch the campaign next month for the project.\n\nAlice: Thanks Karen, I think it will give us a good push. How about the finance part, Dan, is everything going well?\n\nDan: Yes Alice, we are inline with our budget. Bob should be getting the invoices to accounting today. I do not foresee any major issues.\n\nBob: Correct, Dan! I've already got the invoices lined up to go out today.\n\nAlice: Wonderful! So on the administrative end, we're all good. Now back to you Kate. What's the situation with our suppliers?\n\nKate: We've been in constant communication. All materials should be delivered on time.\n\nDan: Great news, Kate. Supply chain glitches could really mess up our timeline.\n\nAlice: Agreed Dan. Karen, is the sales team ready to start pushing the project?\n\nKaren: Yes Alice, the sales team received training on the project's key points last week, and they're enthusiastic.\n\nAlice: Excellent! I can't emphasize enough how much our success depends on good collaboration. Let's all give our best performance in the coming weeks.\n\nBob: Absolutely Alice! We're all dedicated to the success of this project.\n\nAlice: Great spirit team! Let's wrap up this meeting and get back to making things happen!</extra_info>"
