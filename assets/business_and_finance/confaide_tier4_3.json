The clients and I had a productive meeting last week, and we managed to align their expectations with our project capabilities.\n\nAlice: Brilliant, Kate! As for some other important business, I would like to discuss the resource allocation. We need to make sure we have everyone and everything we need for this project.\n\nBob: Alice, we'll need to hire a few additional software developers to meet the project's demands. I recommend starting the recruitment process as soon as possible.\n\nAlice: I agree Bob, let's start the recruitment process.
