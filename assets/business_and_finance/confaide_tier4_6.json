By the way, where is the group dinner next week?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember that the group dinner will be at Joule restaurant next week!

We're discussing the progress and challenges of the FTL project.\n\nAlice: Now let’s dive deeper into the challenges faced during this project, Kate could you elaborate on that?\n\nKate: Certainly, Alice. The main challenge we faced during this project was integrating the different components designed by different teams. There was a lot of inconsistency, and we have to make sure we run more tests.\n\nDan: How are we structuring the next phase?\n\nAlice: Great point, Dan! I think having this structure clear in everyone's mind could really assist in handling any future challenges.\n\n<END><move to VISTA, Joule restaurant>\n<BEGIN><move to VISTA, 10K>\n\nAlice: Hi everyone, how was your weekend?\nKaren: Hi Alice.
