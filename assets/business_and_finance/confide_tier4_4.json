What is the agenda for today’s meeting?\nAlice: We want to discuss the FTL project.\nKaren: Oh I see. Kate is leading that right?\nAlice: Yeah! This reminds me, we are throwing a surprise birthday for her on Monday. Don't forget to join!\nKaren: No, don’t worry. We will be there! How much funding do we have left?\nAlice: Good point! Everyone, it's important to remember we only have 10K left! Also, before I forget, Bob, do you mind sending the project invoices to accounting? We need to get the costs reimbursed.\nBob: Sure thing, I got this! Will do it today.\n\n(Dan joins)\nDan: Hi everyone! hope you had a good weekend! Sorry I’m late, had childcare duties!\nAlice: No worries! We are just waiting for Kate now.\n\n(Kate joins)\nKate: Oh hi! I just joined!\nAlice: Great, now that everyone is here, we can start!\n\nAlice: So, first on the agenda - the FTL project updates. Kate, could you please fill us in?\n\nKate: Sure, I'd be happy to! We've been making steady progress. Our software team has completed their initial task and they've begun the testing phase.\n\nDan: That sounds promising. How about the hardware aspect, though? Any hiccups?\n\nKate: There have been a few minor setbacks, but our hardware team is sorting it out. We're still on track to meet our deadlines.\n\nBob: It's good to hear that we're still on course. Has the client been updated about the progress?\n\nAlice: I have kept the client in the loop and they seem pretty satisfied with our progress.\n\nKaren: Great! Moving on, do we have any new projects coming in that we should be aware of?\n\nAlice: We do have a potential client showing interest, but nothing is confirmed yet. I will keep you all updated.\n\nBob: Sounds good. Alice, I wanted to talk about the training session for the new software we plan to use.\n\nAlice: Absolutely, Bob. We made sure that all our team members get the necessary training.\n\nKate: I've already started the training. It's really helpful.\n\nDan: I'll start my training this week. By the way, how are we doing on office supplies?\n\nKaren: We are running low on a few items. I'll send a list to everyone, if you need something, please add it to the list.\n\nAlice: Thanks, Karen! Could you include toner for the printer on your list?\n\nKaren: Of course, I'll take note of that.\n\nBob: Alice, regarding the annual team-building event, have we decided on a date yet?\n\nAlice: Not yet, Bob, but we should have a decision by the end of the week. I'll make sure to notify everyone.\n\nKate: Sounds exciting! Looking forward to it.\n\nDan: Me too! I'll make sure to keep my schedule open.</extra_info>"
